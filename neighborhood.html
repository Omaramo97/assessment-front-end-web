<h1>Little town of Crowley</h1>
<p>Crowley is a small town that has most things nearby, all the essentials atleast. 
    With downtown being atleast 30min or an hour so away. Luckily my neighborhood situates
    in between both so practically in the goldilocks zone. Even though I've been here for a short amount
    of time, currenlty about 3 months now, It's easy to find myself around the town. I'll share a few points of
    interests that I often frequent.
</p>

<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<p> The usual Restaurants are around, however the main delicacy is barbeque. 
    What joint is better is really up to debate that will never end, However I'll 
    list a personal favorite few:
    <ul>
        <li class="Jambo"><a href="https://www.yellowpages.com/listings/480055563/directions">Jambo's BBQ Shack</a></li>
        <p>Literally a small shack, that has a plethora of food options. You're able to order and pick up,
            however deliveries aren't possible. It doesn't matter much anyway a little bit of fresh air to grab isn't bad.
            On a serious note though, the food is fresh and never disappoints. So if you want variety an large quantity on your 
            plate, Jambo's won't let you down!
        </p>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li class ="Blacks"><a href="https://www.austintexas.org/listings/blacks-bbq/8278/">Black's BBQ</a></li>
        <p>You'll have to travel a bit out for this if you don't mind it. When you had a hard day a work and want to grab 
            a nice bite to eat, Black's BBQ will quench your hunger. Friendly staff that'll make you feel welcome,
            last time I went, something I wasn't prepared for was a nice conversation while my food was being prepared.
            Nice environment and quiet if you just want to relax and enjoy your meal, or simply just take the goodies home.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li class ="Roadhouse"><a href="https://togo.texasroadhouse.com/location/347-ftworth-stx/digital-menu">Texas Roadhouse</a></li>
        <p>Often packed and not what I would pick on my free time, howoever if you dont't mind the pack of people then it's fine.
            You won't be sitting long, as I've actually seen staff come get you if you look a little lonely. Overall its a nice
            place overall with friends or family etc. The reason though I put this on my favorites is because their Ribeye steak
            was the best I had so far, and because of it, deserves a recommendation from me.
