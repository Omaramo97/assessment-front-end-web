    <h1>Heya! my name is Omar Abdullah </h1>
    <p>Welcome to my profile page, and here are some quick things
        about myself
    </p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Persistent in problem solving</li>
    <li>Mario kart is my game, abilities are out of this world </li>
    <li>Creative thinker... sort of</li>
    <li>Always try to stay positive</li>
</ul>

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>Life is interesting in it's own way, and with personal Interests, 
    it can help be productive during leisure time. Here are a few that I have.
</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Usually during my downtime, I like to journal my day and how it went.
    Often times when I look back at what was written, I can see things that
    maybe I overlooked or find funny. I just like writing since it helps articulate 
    my ideas better, especially when it's on paper. Things that don't make sense
    are more shown as well
</p>

<h3>Conversations</h3>
<p>As simple as it sounds, when you find someone who is like-minded it can be amazing.
    Whether fun, trivial, or debating, conversations are always interesting since you
 get to see what another person may think or go about it. Were already familiar with our 
 own way of thinking, but to see from another's perspective, is something that alwasy fascinates me.
</p>

<h3>Crafting</h3>

<p>Currently crafting is my weak point. However the idea to be able to create by hand
    is very cool to me. For examples, people who can build their own contraptions like a 
    exploding package of glitter when a porch thief tries to steal it, is inspiring. Above and
    beyond there is so much more, overall being able to create anything with the skills and tools
    is satisfying and something I try ever now and then.
